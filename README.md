# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Import in Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using dynamic imports within a layout in Next.js 15's App Router.

## Bug Description

When importing a component dynamically within a layout, the component might not render correctly or the layout might not behave as expected. This issue is likely related to the way Next.js handles dynamic imports in the new App Router architecture.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.

## Expected Behavior

The dynamically imported component should render correctly within the layout, and the layout should function as intended.

## Actual Behavior

The dynamically imported component does not render, or the layout experiences unexpected issues.

## Solution

The solution might involve restructuring the application or using a different approach to import components dynamically within a layout. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a possible solution.
